That’s an excellent goal 👍
With **2027 as your start year**, you have **plenty of time** to prepare properly. Below is a **clear, step-by-step preparation plan and travel roadmap** designed specifically for **traveling all over India** (state-wise, slow and meaningful travel).

I’ll divide it into **3 phases** so it’s easy to follow.

## 🧭 PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Now – Dec 2026)

**Goal:** Be financially, mentally, physically, and logistically ready.

### 1️⃣ Define Your Travel Style (Very Important)

Decide this early, everything else depends on it:

* 🚗 **Mode**: Bike / Car / Public transport (train + bus)
* ⏳ **Pace**: Slow travel (1–2 weeks per state) or fast
* 🏕️ **Stay**: Budget hotels, hostels, homestays, camping
* 📸 **Purpose**: Exploration, content creation, vlogging, blogging, spiritual, food, culture

👉 *Suggestion for full-India travel*:
**Train + bus + rented bike locally** (cheapest + flexible)
